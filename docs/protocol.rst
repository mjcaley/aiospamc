SPAMC/SPAMD Protocol As Implemented by SpamAssassin
###################################################

**********************
Requests and Responses
**********************

The structure of a request is similar to an HTTP request. [1]_  The method/verb,
protocol name and version are listed followed by headers separated by newline
characters (carriage return and linefeed or ``\r\n``).  Following the headers
is a blank line with a newline (``\r\n``).  If there is a message body it will
be added after all headers.

The current requests are :ref:`check_request`, :ref:`headers_request`,
:ref:`ping_request`, :ref:`process_request`, :ref:`report_request`,
:ref:`report_ifspam_request`, :ref:`skip_request`, :ref:`symbols_request`, and
:ref:`tell_request`::

    METHOD SPAMC/1.5\r\n
    HEADER_NAME1 : HEADER_VALUE1\r\n
    HEADER_NAME2 : HEADER_VALUE2\r\n
    ...
    \r\n
    REQUEST_BODY

Note: REQUEST_BODY must end with \n.If the data does not end with \n spamd will not return results.

The structure of responses are also similar to HTTP responses.  The protocol
name, version, status code, and message are listed on the first line.  Any
headers are also listed and all are separated by newline characters.  Following
the headers is a newline.  If there is a message body it’s included after all
headers::

    SPAMD/1.5 STATUS_CODE MESSAGE\r\n
    HEADER_NAME1 : HEADER_VALUE1\r\n
    HEADER_NAME2 : HEADER_VALUE2\r\n
    ...
    \r\n
    RESPONSE_BODY

the responses that you can expect to receive.

    The SpamAssassin daemon must have the ``--allow-tell`` option enabled to
    support this feature.

Response from a request that sent a :ref:`remove_header`::

    SPAMD/1.1 0 EX_OK
    DidRemove: local
    Content-length: 2
    

Response from a request that sent a :ref:`set_header`::

    SPAMD/1.1 0 EX_OK
    DidSet: local
    Content-length: 2
    

.. _headers:

*******
Headers
*******

Headers are structured very simply.  They have a name and value which are
separated by a colon (:).  All headers are followed by a newline.  The current
headers include :ref:`compress_header`, :ref:`content-length_header`,
:ref:`didremove_header`, :ref:`didset_header`, :ref:`message-class_header`,
:ref:`remove_header`, :ref:`set_header`, :ref:`spam_header`, and
:ref:`user_header`.

For example::

    Content-length: 42\r\n

The following is a list of headers defined by SpamAssassin, although anything
is allowable as a header.  If an unrecognized header is included in the
request or response it should be ignored.
